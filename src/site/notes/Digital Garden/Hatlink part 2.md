I assume you have made [[Digital Garden/Hatlight Platformer Step 1|Hatlight Platformer Step 1]].

In that we had a jump routine, but it was a temporary solution. 

Here are some problems to notice:

* If you jump below a platform, the sprite is pushed up through the platform. Instead, it is more realistic for the sprite to bounce.
* And, while you are inside that platform you can move left to right. That is also unrealistic.
* The when up arrow stack lets you jump in mid-air. We used this to fix that:
```ad-scratch
title: 
~~~scratchblock
wait until < ([abs v] of (y speed)) < (8)>
~~~
```
* Still, the jump is "wobbly". 
* Right now we fall in steps, but our jump routine makes a big step up when we jump. We are going to jump in steps as well, so that we can detect platforms. 

## Distance to the ground
The first step we will take is to keep track of our distance to the ground. 
1. create a variable `distance to ground`
2. initialize it in the initialize routine:

```ad-scratch
title: hitbox, initialize stack 
~~~scratchblock
when I receive [initialize v]
...
set [distance to ground v] to [0]
...
~~~
```

Next we change `distance to ground` inside the `change y by xspeed...` stack. Note that we duplicate the condition in the `change y block`, so the two change the same way.

```ad-scratch
title: hitbox, define change y by (yspeed)
~~~scratchblock
define change y by (yspeed) by single steps
repeat ([abs v] of (yspeed::custom)::operators)
    change [distance to ground v] by ((-1) * <not <touching [walls v]?>>)
    change y by ((-1) * <not <touching [walls v]?>>)
end
~~~
```

we also change  `pull out if touching...` but in a slightlly different way. Here we want to make sure that the distance to the ground will be zero when we are done  pulling out (which means touching the wall and falling). Therefore we multiply the condition by `-1 * distance to ground`. This cancels whatever value is in there.

```ad-scratch
title: hitbox, define pull up
~~~scratchblock
define pull up or down if touching walls and <falling?> or not
change [y speed v] by (<touching [walls v]?> * ((-1) * (y speed)))
change [distance to ground v] by (<touching [walls v]?> * (<falling?::custom> * ((distance to ground) * (-1))))
change y by (<touching [walls v]?> * (falling?::custom)
~~~
```

Notice that:
```ad-scratch
~~~scratchblock
change [distance to ground v] by (<touching [walls v]?> * (<falling?::custom> * ((distance to ground) * (-1))))
~~~
```
is the same as, but all in one line:
```ad-scratch
~~~scratchblock

  
if <(<falling?::custom> * <touching [walls v]?>) = (1)> then
    set [distance to ground v] to (0)
end

~~~
```

## Change jump routine
Now we can change the jump routine so that we only jump when we are close to the ground.

First, to make sure we are only jumping at the right time, let's change from a `when up arrow pressed` to `receive jump`. Delete **this entire stack**:

```ad-scratch
title: hitbox, when up arrow stack
~~~scratchblock
when [up arrow v] key pressed
...
~~~
```

and replace it with:

```ad-scratch
title: hitbox, jump stack
~~~scratchblock
when I receive [jump v]
if <key [up arrow v] pressed?>  then
    change [y speed v] by ((20) * <(distance to ground) \< [5]>)
    change [distance to ground v] by ((20) * <(distance to ground) \< [5]>)
end
broadcast [move left / right v]
~~~
```
This changes the speed by 20 only if we are close to the ground.

Then change the `broadcast` at the bottom of fall like this:

```ad-scratch
title: hitbox, fall stack
~~~scratchblock
not
broadcast [move left / right v]

instead
broadcast [jump v]

~~~
```
Run it to test it. Is it working still? 

No, it shouldn't. We have one more thing to do. The problem is that, as I wrote above,

* Right now we fall in steps, but our jump routine makes a big step up when we jump. We are going to jump in steps as well, so that we can detect platforms. 

So, how do we do that? We keep track of whether we are falling by making a new variable to keep track of the sign:

```ad-scratch
title: 
~~~scratchblock
set [sign of y speed v] to (<(y speed) \> [0]> - <(y speed) \< [0]>)
~~~
```
This will be **1** if we are jumping and **-1** if we are falling. Then we put this is in the change y by stack, and change **-1** to `sign of y speed`. 


```ad-scratch
title: hitbox, define change y by (yspeed)
~~~scratchblock
define change y by (yspeed) by single steps
set [sign of y speed v] to (<(y speed) \> [0]> - <(y speed) \< [0]>)
repeat ([abs v] of (yspeed::custom)::operators)
    change [distance to ground v] by ((sign of y speed) * <not <touching [walls v]?>>)
    change y by ((sign of y speed) * <not <touching [walls v]?>>)
end
~~~
```

That should work. You might have to change the numbers in the **jump stack** for the  `change y speed` and `distance to ground` block to make it work. Things like the size of your hitbox and what your platform looks like can make a difference.
