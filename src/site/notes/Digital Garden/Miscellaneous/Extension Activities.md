You can play a scratch project from the Break Time Studio. You can play the game for no mor that 5 minutes. Then you should make a report on it. Think about the following questions. 
* What kind of project is it?
  * Be specific: Art dump, Battle Game, Mario type game, Puzzle, etc.
* How do you play the game?
  * What kind of user input is there? Are there levels? 
* What would you keep if you were remixing it?
* What would you change if you were remixing it?
* What would you add if you were remixing it?
* What was your favorite part?
* How many stars? You can give negative stars:
  * -2 Don't bother trying it. It was bad. Real bad.
  * -1 I didn't like it but others might. Overall, I didn't like it, but some people might.
  * 0 ok, average, normal. Nothing special.
  * 1 I would recommend it. There was something cool about it. Overall I liked it.
