# Adding Loops and Rearranging Platforms 
## Set up the Costume Numbers

You should now have 4 costumes for the loop. To make this easier, give them the following names: 

- Platform: **My loop start** and **My loop return**
- Antiplatform: **My antiloop start** and **My antiloop return**

The important thing is that the start and return costumes have the **same number in each sprite**. To make it easier, use 21 and 22, like I am doing.  In other words, make:

Your costume 20 is probably the Loop Base.

We won't actually use this in the game. Put a blank if you need to.

**COSTUME 21**: **My loop start** ![Loop Start|25](https://i.imgur.com/IGxRDRU.png) is costume 21 in Platform, and so is **My antiloop start** ![Antiloop Start|25](https://i.imgur.com/2y0ilLK.png)
(in Antiplatform)
**COSTUME 21**: **My loop return** ![Loop Return|25](https://i.imgur.com/199xT9m.png) is costume 22 in Platform, and so is **My antiloop return** ![Antiloop Return|25](https://i.imgur.com/zP2NbbN.png)(in Antiplatform)

Same *number*, but *different costumes*. Move any other costumes you made **to the end of the list**. Keep costumes 1-20 the same.
