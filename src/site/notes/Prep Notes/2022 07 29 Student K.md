### MAIKEY

```

LET'S MAKE SURE MAIKEY IS POINTING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 

MAKE THIS INTO:

when I receive [c.b v]
set rotation style [left-right v]
set [HP v] to [100]
hide
repeat until <not <(HP) > [0]>>
    set [MAIKEY DIRECTION v] to (direction)
    if <key [space v] pressed?> then
        broadcast [attack v]
    end
end

to the right arrow:
point in direction (90)

to the left arrow
point in direction (-90)
```

### in WEAPONS

```
if <touching mouse-pointer> then
say (costume name)
else
say ()
end
change all costume names to weapon name
```
