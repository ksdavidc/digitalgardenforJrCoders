## AI Art Gallery

## API Access / Bulk Creation

Add this service anywhere with the Hotpot [API](https://hotpot.ai/docs/api) or [self-hosted containers](https://hotpot.ai/docs/self-hosted).

API access requires payment. [Contact us](https://hotpot.ai/contact) for pricing.

No-code bulk creation is also available. [Contact us](https://hotpot.ai/contact) for details.

## Custom Styles

For custom styles, be specific. For instance, "Oil painting of water lilies with vibrant brushstrokes using a happy color palette" is better than "lily flowers". See below for example instructions and [see here](https://imgur.com/a/SALxbQm) for example outputs.

Custom Examples:

-   Oil painting of water lilies with vibrant brushstrokes using a happy color palette
-   A portrait of Taylor Swift with harmonic colors of purple and yellow
-   An underwater explosion with vibrant colors
-   A painting of wine glasses with harmonic colors and thin brushstrokes
-   Happy raindrops in the style of Vincent Van Gogh's painting, Starry Night
-   The ocean at sunset in the style of an oil painting, with smooth gradients of purple and yellow and bright, happy colors
-   Creative oil painting of the ocean at sunset, with smooth gradients of purple and yellow
-   The sunset over the desert in the style of Claude Monet using bright and harmonic colors
-   Flying fish in the style of Pablo Picasso using smooth gradients of yellow and blue

  
To modify seed images, provide specific and realistic directions. Our AI is good, but not God. Guide our AI toward reasonable changes to the seed image with simple, concrete instructions.

Seed Image Examples:

-   Bad: Make our founder as handsome as Brad Pitt
-   Good: Fantasy oil painting in blue color
-   Bad: Make our founder look less awkward in this prom photo
-   Good: Gorgeous watercolor painting with purple and yellow hues

## Pricing & Licensing

Buy credits for commercial use and shorter wait times.

Free images are licensed under [CC BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

For legal purposes, we store cryptographic hashes of generated graphics -- but not the graphics themselves. This allows us to identify Hotpot creations.

## Wait Time

-   Creation takes 20 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the settings. If traffic is high, it may take 2-3 hours for free requests. Paid requests should come back in seconds or minutes.
    
    For faster wait times, please buy credits. Paid users can skip the line. (Paid users subsidize free use.)
    
    Waiting sucks. Sorry. We're working hard to fix this. Google/Azure employee? Contact us. We want to break up with AWS.
    

## Art Maker FAQ

-   What are the different models?
    
    The different models represent different AIs for creating images and art.
    
    Model 3 is the fastest and is free. Model 1 is more creative but takes much longer and requires more server processing, which is why it costs money. Dall-E Mini is coming soon.
    
-   What do "Make Private" and "Make Results Different" do?
    
    Free creations are viewable by the public in our [AI Art Gallery](https://hotpot.ai/gallery/8/ai-art-maker). Public creations are anonymous.
    
    Enable "Make Private" to keep creations out of the public gallery. This subsidizes free users. Paid creations are private by default.
    
    By default, our AI tries to produce consistent results if you reuse descriptions. "Make Results Different" tells our AI to act unpredictably. If you reuse the same description, our AI will try to produce different images.
    
-   Can I create multiple images at once?
    
    Yes, but only for paid creations. Free creations are limited to one at a time, but you may run multiple paid creations in parallel.
    
    This is required to support free creations. If you violate these rules, our system may ban your account or ignore creations. Most importantly, other users will get annoyed at you for hogging Hotpot servers.
    
    For free creations, wait for the image to return or contact us if the wait time has been exceeded.
    
-   Can I sell graphics or use them for NFTs?
    
    Yes, but first buy credits: one license per graphic.
    
    Second, treat Hotpot as a digital helper who augments your workflow, someone who helps brainstorm and automate tedious work -- but not someone who eliminates the creative process. We cannot guarantee uniquess anymore than Photoshop can. It is possible for someone to produce something comparable with other AI or software, much like any logo or graphic can be reproduced.
    
    Ultimately, it's your responsibility to make unique graphics and honor intellectual property laws. To make this easier, use our [AI Art Remixer](https://hotpot.ai/personalize-art?s=art-maker) to uniquely style creations or use seed images.
    
-   Can I close the page?
    
    Yes. First save the image URL. If you create an account, creations are saved to your account.
    
    Paid users get more storage. Please buy credits to save all creations.
    
-   Can you guarantee unique creations?
    
    No service can guarantee this, but our [AI Art Remixer](https://hotpot.ai/personalize-art?s=art-maker) lets you uniquely style each creation. Using custom seed images also increase uniqueness.
    
    Even if we prevent others from reusing your identical prompt, others may use similar prompts and produce similar results. If another graphic looks 90% the same, is yours truly unique? The safest approach is to treat Hotpot like a digital helper who augments your workflow, someone who helps brainstorm and automate tedious work -- but not someone who eliminates the creative process.
    
-   Is this art?
    
    Art is not defined by means of production. This is why handcrafted paintings from 1st graders are not considered art while professional illustrators made with Adobe software often are. In our [founder's opinion](https://twitter.com/panabee/status/1377646728413782023), art is an opinion that stirs the soul while elevated art is an opinion that stirs the mind.
    
    What matters is the opinion, not the means.
    
    Imagine you hired an art student and dicated every stroke, every color, detail of a painting. Make this angle sharper. Make that line thicker. Add some purple there. The student robotically executes the commands. Who is the artist: you or the student?
    
    AI cannot offer this degree of precision today, but it can spark creativity and spawn compelling ideas for further refinement, much as a junior employee might generate suggestions for an experienced supervisor.
    
    In short, perhaps raw output from AI may not qualify as art -- someone please consult the spirit of Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart -- but there is no reason why the collaborative output between you and AI cannot.
    
-   Fine. Maybe this is kinda cool, but is this intelligence?
    
    As our founder [asserts](https://twitter.com/panabee/status/1512279373088378883), fixating on intelligence is semantic quicksand and misses the point: can AI help people? And can we control AI?
    
    Intelligence is an undefinable concept -- go ahead, try to define it. :) Most critically, intelligence is uncorrelated to societal impact.
    
    Viruses are not alive, let alone intelligent, yet they can devastate countries and polarize people in a way that would make the Devil jealous. Farm tractors are incredibly dumb (Sorry, not sorry, if you're offended.), but they have enabled humanity to avert Malthusian predictions of doom and ensured 7 billion people are fed and well-nourished. (Malthus must have been super fun. Friend: "Thomas, good morning!" Thomas: "Bad morning. Humans will be extinct soon." Wife: "Thomas, want to go for a walk? The moon is so romantic tonight." Thomas: "Nah, conserving calories for the Great Famine.")
    
    Please don't get sucked into the outrage debate on AI sentience. The Google model is no more sentient than the Magic 8 ball (which is awesome and predicted that you would read this). Shockingly, in the age of clickbait articles and cable hot takes, a shallow attempt to grab the spotlight ... managed to grab the spotlight with a terrifying, but patently false, claim.
    
-   Will AI replace humans?
    
    If you believe this, please use Siri. :)
    
    On a serious note, we see AI more as "augmented intelligence" than "artificial intelligence" -- technology that augments people rather than replaces them. Someday, researchers may invent general intelligence and displace humans, but that day is not today nor tomorow.
    
    Until then, AI can empower individuals by sparking creativity and automating tasks. Those who dismiss machine learning overlook how much reptition occurs in human jobs and the creative process, including art and programming.
    
    Analyze your work activities. How many tasks are boring and mundane? If your company could hire a junior person to perform those duties, even 50% of them, and free you to focus on more meaningful tasks, would you want this? This is the potential for AI.
    
    Even if general intelligence never materializes, AI offers the tantalizing prospect of automating many laborious tasks for knowledge workers in the same way machines automated laborious tasks for farm workers. These machines were not intelligent and did not eliminate farmers, but they did augment abilities and unlock historic levels of productivity and societal gains. Without farming technology, it would be impossible to feed the 7 billion people alive today.
    
    Frankly, this scenario of augmented intelligence is more feasible and quite appealing. While a world where AI can disregard humans may usher in an era of unthinkable risk, a world where AI can maximize the potential of each and every person could introduce unprecedented levels of joy, health, and prosperity.
    
-   Is Web3 useful technology or a massive scam?
    
    We don't know yet. Longer answer [here](https://twitter.com/panabee/status/1550973256135573506).
    
-   Burgers or fries first?
    
    Fries, always fries. Duh.
    
    If you wondered, "Why is this FAQ suddenly asking about fries," my friend, you lose. You have been outed as not human, likely an AI robot sent from the future (or maybe a Magic 8 ball with human skin).
    
    This famous question from the Stanford psychology department is widely regarded as the quintessential test of humanity: true humans instinctively answer then grab their phone to order fries so they can gain weight which they are obligated to work off while fantasizing about burgers and fries. Illogical behavior like this uniquely defines the human race. The study was published by a distinguished professor, and remains the gold standard when the FBI interviews subjects to determine if they are human or alien.
    
    Read it yourself: [the conclusions](https://hotpot.ai/hotpotcha) are shocking and almost impossible to believe.
    
-   Can you promote my art or NFT?
    
    Yes! Please tag us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hotpothelper) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hotpot.ai/) if you want to show off your awesome Hotpot creations.
    
    We love promoting people with compelling stories and cool art who collaborated with Hotpot. Tag us, share details about your background, your work, and how Hotpot helped. We'll do our best to amplify your story on social media and with bloggers.
    
-   I'm on a budget. Can you offer a discount?
    
    Yes, [contact us](https://hotpot.ai/contact). Our [pricing philosophy](https://hotpot.ai/pricing) is to help the poor and charge the rich.
    
-   Google/Microsoft employee or Nvidia shareholder?
    
    Please reach out if you work at Google or Microsoft. We're ready to break up with AWS. Nvidia shareholders, please reach out or broker an introduction to Jensen. The company could unlock billions in shareholder value with one tiny change.
